                <div class="article__text">
                    <p>Tokens are tied up to capitalization growth of the private share, there will be different cases with different rules. But for most part we will hold on private equity until major event will occur, for example private company goes to IPO, or being bought out by monopolist VC. That’s when the closing time will occur, payout revenue will be spread among token holders equal to the amount of their tokens.
                    <br>For those who don’t want to wait for closing period:
                    <br>Tokenize shares will be circulating in private Exchange where you can trade it and come out of the deal earlier.</p>

                    <p>What <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> is going to launch now is a pre-sale and the amount mentioned as a hardcap is more than enough to get things done with the development processes.</p>

                    <p>We are definitely going to set the following stages of attracting the funds ,which all of us assuming as a main crowd sale.</p>

                    <p>However, the main crowd sale is moreover not to be held through the typical way of funding based on smart contract option, BUT in terms of offering by <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> the <span class="--main_color">OPL</span> tokens  on the public exchanges in small amounts .</p>

                    <p>At the same time, tokens that were saved for reservation by us will have much higher price, rather than those that were offered to our contributors during the upcoming pre-sale.</p>
                    <p>This will let us attract significantly more investments , that is also a response to your interests as a earlier investors of <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> project.</p>
