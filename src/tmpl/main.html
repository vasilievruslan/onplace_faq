                    <span class="--main_color">OPL</span> token which we offer during TGE is a currency. There’s going to be two type of tokens. The first one is a utility token, which is the one that pre-sale participants can purchase on February 1. This token will be circulating on different exchanges, it is the domestic currency for the <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> ecosystem. The second type of token will be a security token, this token will be backed by shares of private companies. The only way to purchase a security token is through <span class="--main_color">OPL</span>. <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> will be the legal private asset holder, and security token holders will be members of participation.

                <div class="article__text">
                    The companies that were mentioned in the whitepaper were just an example. We mentioned companies like Uber and Xiaomi to be tokenized through PATS protocol, however, as for now, we do not consider Uber and Xiaomi as a companies to be tokenized with PATS protocol. At this point they are already over-capitalized, but we have some interesting options to provide participants with, which are similar to Uber or Xiaomi 3-4 years ago.

                <h1 class="article__title">8. HOW <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> TOKEN HOLDER WILL BENEFIT?<span class="arr-bottom"></span></h1>
                <div class="article__text">
                    Tokens are tied up to capitalization growth of private shares. There will be different cases with different rules. But for the most part we will hold on to private equity until a major event occurs, for example, the private company goes to IPO, or is being bought out by VC monopolists. That’s when the closing time will occur, payout revenue will be spread among token holders equal to the amount of their tokens. For those who don’t want to wait for the closing period: Tokenized shares will be circulating in private Exchange, where you can trade it and come out of the deal earlier.

                <div class="article__text">
                    What <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> is going to launch now is a pre-sale, and the amount mentioned as a hardcap is more than enough to get things done with the development processes. We are definitely going to set subsequent stages of attracting the funds, which all of us assume to be the main crowdsale. However, the main crowdsale surely is not going to be held in a typical way, BUT RATHER <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> will offer <span class="--main_color">OPL</span> through smart contracts based on public exchange rates. At the same time, tokens that we reserve will have a much higher price than those that are offered to our contributors during the upcoming pre-sale. This will let us attract significantly more investments that are also a response to your interests as earlier investors of the <span class="--main_color">OnPlace</span> project.

                    We don’t want to publish dates and milestones of which we are not 100 % sure, some milestones will depend on how much will be collected during the pre-sale. If we collect a hard cap, then we will reach some milestones much faster. As soon as we get the investments obtained from the pre-sale, we will provide an updated roadmap regarding the company’s nearest future.
